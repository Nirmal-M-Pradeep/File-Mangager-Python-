This a project which i did during my internship,the ui was made using Qt Designer and the functionality implemented using  Python.It has every functionality needed by a user for browsing thrrough the files and manipulating the contents,Although it is not as advanced as the Filemanager of windows.

One of the disadavatages are it lacks a recycle bin feature,

It has UI design very similar to that of Linux's File Manager
